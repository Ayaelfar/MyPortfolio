                        <p class="about__text">As a medical student at Delta University for Science and Technology, I'm deeply committed to pursuing a career as a cardiothoracic surgeon.

                            But my interests extend beyond medicine alone. I'm also passionate about human rights advocacy and using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in this area. I believe that everyone deserves dignity, respect, and equal opportunities regardless of their background or circumstances.
                            
                            I'm interested in exploring new ways to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. <br> <br> As someone who is passionate about the future of healthcare, I believe that academic research and digital health are two fields that hold tremendous promise. 
                            
                            One of the things that drives me forward is my love of discovery and learning. I find the field of medicine endlessly fascinating, from the latest research findings to innovative treatments and technologies. I'm always eager to explore new areas and expand my knowledge in this field.</p>

                            As a Local Officer of Human Rights and Peace at Delta Student Scientific Society, I have had the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge about human rights and their importance. <br> <br> Through my role, I have developed a deep understanding of sigma in healthcare and how it can be addressed to ensure that everyone has access to high-quality care. This experience has not only taught me about human rights and peace, but it has also helped me to appreciate the diversity of humanity. <br> <br> No matter how different we may appear on the surface, we are all fundamentally human with basic needs and rights that should be respected and protected.

                        <p>
                            I am a TNRT international trainer with a passion for youth activism and research. I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience through my involvement with the International Federation of Medical Student Associations (IFMSA), a non-governmental organization that focuses on global health and medical education. After completing IFMSA's training program, I became a certified youth activism facilitator and international trainer.

                            <br> <br> As an international trainer, I have developed expertise in research and academic research. I am able to design and deliver sessions both within and outside IFMSA, providing participants with insights and practical tips regarding the basics of research. Additionally, I am equipped to train others on how to become research trainers themselves.

                            <br> <br> In addition to my technical skills, I have also honed my soft skills, such as session management, which has been instrumental in delivering effective and engaging training sessions. Overall, my experience with IFMSA has given me a well-rounded skill set, allowing me to make a positive impact in the areas of youth activism, research, and education.

                        <h3>Training TDMT at SRT</h3>
                        <p>
                            The TDMT training at SRT was an incredible opportunity for me to gain an extensive amount of knowledge in various fields. One of the most important topics we covered was disaster medicine, which involved learning about providing medical aid during and after natural disasters and other emergencies. <br> <br> Moreover, the training also covered the topic of human rights and humanitarian risks. We learned how to provide aid while respecting the dignity and autonomy of those affected by disasters.

                            <br> <br> Apart from the theoretical knowledge gained, the training program also included a practical side that allowed us to apply what we had learned in a real-life situation.

                            <br> <br> Finally, the TDMT training at SRT was an excellent opportunity to meet new people from different countries. Interacting with participants from various backgrounds was enlightening, and we were able to share our experiences and learn from each other through discussions on human rights, humanitarian risks, and disaster medicine.
